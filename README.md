# DuplOne---Assembly-Compilator
Simple assembly pseudo-compilator in go (school project)

To run it you just need to put the .exe file inside the same directory of your assembly code. The assembly code needs to be in a file called "index.as".

Code example

```
mov a 5
mov <36> a
mov a 2
out
dec a
out
jnz <36>
out
```
